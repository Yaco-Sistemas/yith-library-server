  <h1>Terms of service</h1>

      <h2>Free software</h2>

      <p>Yith Library Server is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
	it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
	the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
	(at your option) any later version.</p>

      <p>Among many things being free software means Yith Library users have four
	essential freedoms:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
	<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
	  does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the
	  <a href="https://github.com/Yaco-Sistemas/yith-library-server">source
	    code</a> is a precondition for this.</li>
	<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
	  neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
	<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
	  others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a
	  chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the
	  <a href="https://github.com/Yaco-Sistemas/yith-library-server">source
	    code</a> is a precondition for this.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can read the GNU Affero General Public License at
	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Data ownership</h2>

      <p>You own your personal data and all the passwords stored in your account.</p>

      <p>You can export such data in a machine readable format any time you want. If
	you want, we will send you a backup of your passwords once a month.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="span6">

      <h2>No warranty</h2>

      <p>Yith Library Server is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
	but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
	MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
	GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

      <h2>Cookies usage. No tracking</h2>

      <p>We use cookies for the sole purpose of managing a session for you.</p>

      <p>Optionally and if you allow it we use Google Analytics to learn more about
	our users. This way we can optimize Yith Library and priorize our changes
	so you are served better. Knowing our users habits also helps us to
	scale our infrastructure better.</p>

      <h2>Account termination</h2>

      <p>You are free to remove your account and all the data associated with it
	whenever you want. It's a sad event for us but you should have the rights
	to make that decission.</p>

      <h2>No data selling</h2>

      <p>We don't sell your data to any third party company. We do this just for
	fun and because we believe a web password manager is needed to make the
	Internet a safer place.</p>

      <p>Sorry if some of these terms are a little imprecise and sloppy. We are
	hackers, not lawyers. If in doubt, <a href="#">just drop us a line</a>.</p>
